# University department website

![iu3website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31049754/158244568-bc877946-03dc-459d-9323-97070fe2d26f.gif)

Simple university department. It contains all the necessary information for students: News, Schedule, Curriculum and Staff.

I decided to create it because I don't like current website.
